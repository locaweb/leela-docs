This is the stream processor engine, which is a fancy name to a
component that is able to apply functions over a set of events.

It is important to notice that you do not interact with this directly.
Rather it is used by other components, like ``xmpp`` or ``http``, to
fulfill a user request.

Nevertheless, as the functions available here are usually used *as-is*
by users through these *higher level* components, the first part of
this documentation focuses on the available functions, whereas the
second part contains detailed explanation about the protocol.

Function syntax
===============

Each function contains a name, usually as ascii encoded string,
followed by zero or more arguments. For instance, the ``maximum``
function, which computes the maximum value of a set of events, takes
no arguments. Operators are the sole exception to this rule, as they
are enclosed by parenthesis. Currently all functions (as well as
operators) depends solely on the input. They will only produce a
result when it receives one or more events. In other words, they are
pure functions.

You may compose functions using the ``|`` (pipe) operator which
resembles greatly the unix pipe operator. So you may think of each
function as a combinator and using the pipe operator allow you to grow
bigger pipelines. For instance, suppose you have a event that ranges
from *0* to *1*, the following function should compute the *mean* of
the current set of events and then multiply this value by *100* (left
to right application)::

  mean | (* 100)

Operators are always enclosed by parenthesis, with the operand always
on the right. There are only four operators defined, the arithmetic
operators: ``*``, ``+``, ``-`` and ``/``, which respectively computes
the *multiplication*, *addition*, *subtraction* and *division*.

Functions reference
===================

abs
---

Computes the absolute value a number.

ceil
----

Smallest integral value that is not less than the current number.

floor
-----

Largest integral value not greater than the current value.

round
-----

Round towards infinity.

truncate
--------

Round towards zero.

mean
----

The *mean* of the set of events.

sma :n
------

Computes the `simple moving average
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average>`_ of ``n`` items.

**Arguments:**

:n: A positive integer number;

sample :n :m
------------

Samples ``n`` elements out from a population of ``m`` items. The exact
frequency of elements generated by this function is defined as
follows. Let ``L`` the total of elements::
  
  n * (L (mod m)) + minimum n (L (mod m))

**Arguments:**

:n: The number of elements pick out of `m`;
:m: The so called population size;

minimum
-------

The minimum value.

maximum
-------

The maximum value.

prod
----

Multiplication of all values in the stream.

sum
---

Summation of all values in the stream.

window :n :pipeline
-------------------

Creates an window of ``n`` items and when this is full applies a
function to produce a result.

**Arguments:**

:n: An positive integer number [ ``n > 0`` ], which defines the size
    of the window;

:pipeline: The function to apply, enclosed with parenthesis. You may
           use the pipe to combine multiple functions, and all
           functions here defined but ``sma``, ``sample`` and
           ``window``;

**Example:**::
    
  window 30 (mean | (* 100))

id
--

The identity function: ``id x == x``.

Operators reference
===================

:+: Adds some number (e.g.: ``(+ 0)``);
:-: Subtracts some number (e.g.: ``(- 0)``);
:\*: Multiplies by some number (e.g.: ``(* 1)``);
:/: Divides by some number (e.g.: ``(/ 1)``);
